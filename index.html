                    <h2> The Beginning </h2>
                    <p> BTS was formed by Bang Si-Hyuk, a successful songwriter and music producer who established his
                        own studio, Big Hit Entertainment, in 2005. In 2010 he began to assemble talent for a group he
                        was calling the Bangtan Sonyeondan (“Bulletproof Boy Scouts”), which would later become better
                        known as BTS.</p>

                    <h2> Rise to Fame </h2>
                    <p> In 2014, BTS was billed as one of many acts at kcon, a showcase of Korean culture, in Los
                        Angeles. By the fourth kcon, in 2016, BTS was the main draw. In 2017, BTS became the first K-pop
                        group to win a Billboard Music Award (the Top Social Artist award).</p>

                    <h2> Worlwide Artists </h2>
                    <p> One of the most impressive musical acts of all time, by any and every metric. For nine years,
                        BTS put most of its energy towards songs that all seven members made and performed together.
                        They made ripples on the global level with every new song.
                        Last June, however, they announced that they’d be going on a group hiatus to work on individual
                        projects (and serve the compulsory 18 months in South Korea’s military). </p>

                <p> BTS has 23 Guinness World Records. They are the most streamed group on Spotify (beating the British
                    band Coldplay) and the most followed music group on Instagram. </p>
